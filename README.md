# 🧭 Grid Navigator Visualization (Stack-Based DFS)

This is a web-based application that visualizes the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm in real-time. Users can interactively draw a maze, set start and end points, and watch the stack-based backtracking algorithm find a path.

The project features a modern, tech-inspired homepage with a rotating 3D maze animation and a separate, detailed "About DFS" page complete with its own animated example.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Maze:** Click and drag to draw walls on the grid.
* **Set Start & End:** Easily designate the start (🟢) and end (🔴) points.
* **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the DFS algorithm explore (purple) and find the final path (yellow).
* **Adjustable Speed:** Use the speed slider to slow down or speed up the visualization.
* **Hero Homepage:** A landing page featuring a rotating 3D maze built with **Three.js**.
* **About Page:** A detailed explanation of how DFS and Stacks work, complete with a mini-animation.
* **Sticky UI:** A persistent header allows for easy access to controls while scrolling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with CSS Variables, Grid, and Flexbox)
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Three.js** (Imported via CDN for 3D graphics)
